# Redis Clone in Go

A lightweight, in-memory Redis clone built in **Go**🐹 over raw **TCP**, implementing core Redis functionality including transactions, pub/sub, expiration, and LRU eviction.

## Features

### Core Redis Commands
- `GET key`
- `SET key value`
- `DEL key`
- `INCR key` / `DECR key`
- `FLUSHALL`
- `PING`
- `QUIT`

### Expiration Support
- `EXPIRE key seconds` — Set a timeout on a key
- `TTL key` — Get remaining time to live
- Automatic expiry with background eviction.

### Transactions
- `MULTI` — Start transaction
- `EXEC` — Execute queued commands
- `DISCARD` — Cancel transaction
- Queues and executes atomic command blocks per connection

### Publish/Subscribe
- `SUBSCRIBE channel`
- `PUBLISH channel message`
- Real-time pub/sub system with multiple channels

### LRU Cache Eviction
- Auto-evicts **least recently used keys** when size threshold is exceeded
- Built with `container/list` for efficient O(1) updates
- Integrated into `GET`, `SET`, and `DEL` operations

### RESP Protocol Support
- Fully RESP-compliant parser (supports `*`, `$`, `+`, `-`, `:`)
- Allows communication with Redis CLI or custom tools

### Server
- Listens on `tcp://0.0.0.0:6380`
- Handles concurrent clients
- Graceful error handling for malformed inputs

### 🛠️ How to Run

```bash
go run cmd/server/main.go
```
Connect using Redis CLI:
```bash
redis-cli -p 6380
```
 Go CLI layout for benchnark:
 ```bash
go run cmd/benchmark/main.go -clients=50 -requests=100
 ```

## Unit Test

> \[!WARNING\]
> ⚠**Tests are currently under construction**   


Some parts of the system aren't fully covered yet, and there are a few known issues we're ironing out.

- Running test for Cache package

```bash
go test ./internal/cache -v
```
- Test file for the command package to test the Handle function,including GET, SET, SET EX, and DEL

```bash
go test ./internal/command -v
```
- Running test for protocol package 
```bash
go test ./internal/protocol -v
```
- Running test for session package
```bash
go test ./internal/session -v
```
- Running test for persistance package
```bash
go test ./internal/persistence -v
```
- Running test for pubsub package
```bash
go test ./internal/pubsub -v
```
